## Hi there! ðŸ˜„ ðŸŒ¸

Hi there! My name is Caitlin Lamirez (She/Her), and I am an aspiring software engineer. I have a passion in looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science. I currently am a Computer Science major working on my Bachelor's Degree at Lewis University. I do have a background in nursing, and I would love to combine my background in nursing and computer science to create innovative solutions that positively impact society!

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
I am currently working on a project that is focused on developing a computer vision system in Python that can detect the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet using machine learning and OpenCV. The goal is to create a model that can recognize the signs made by a user and translate them into corresponding letters.

Overall, I am very excited to combine my interests in machine learning and computer vision to create a practical application that can help bridge communication barriers for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community ðŸ˜„

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
Currently, I am focused on two main areas of learning: machine learning and full stack development. In addition to learning more about machine learning from the ASL detection project, I am also taking the IBM Full Stack Developer course on Coursera. This course provides a comprehensive overview of the skills and technologies needed to become a full stack developer, including front-end web development, back-end development, cloud computing, and databases.
